# Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Dataset
**Bike-Sharing-Dataset/hour.csv** contains the bike sharing data that I used for training and testing my model.

## Project files:

+ **Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb**  this jupyter notebook describes all stages of the project. It also contains my answer to the question at the end.
+ **my_answers.py** contains my implementation of the network and the hyperparameters that I chose for training
